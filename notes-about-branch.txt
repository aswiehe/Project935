The purpose of this branch is to go through this to go through this repo in a step-wise fashion in order to ensure that all technologies are fully understood. In learning about the specifics of each technology, it's pretty likely that I'll learn concepts that allow me to modify the code in a way that moves the final product closer to the client's person of contact (Kevin Wiehe, youth pastor) desired product. Rather than noting separately, and possibly requiring more time later to "get back up to speed" on a technology, basic edits will be made along the way. Ideally, none of these edits will require much time later, in the event that changes cause unforeseen consequences. This is a once through. Ideally, when/if this branch is merged to its parent branch, the only changes will include beneficial ones. This may include minor changes (such as tweaks to stylesheets, text content, or what will probably be most common, comments in code).
